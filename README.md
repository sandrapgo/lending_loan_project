# Lending Loan Project

## Overview
This notebook represents a project dedicated to the LendingClub Loan Data. LendingClub is an American peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. LendingClub enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on LendingClub website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. LendingClub makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.

Within this project, I seek to achieve two goals. First, to determine some key performance indicators (KPIs) that can provide useful insigths to decision-makers. Second, to build a machine learning algorithm for the purpose of correctly identifying whether a person, given certain characteristics, has a high likelihood to default on a loan. 

In order to develop this data science project, I followed some phases including - data exploration, data cleaning, and feature engineering.

### Dataset Details

The LendingClub files contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.), latest payment information, and credit bureau data (e.g., FICO, revolving balances, etc.) For the purpose of this project, the anlysis includes only the 2015 year data.
